Open or Create vite.config.js (or vite.config.ts if using TypeScript):

This file should be in your project's root directory.
If it doesn't exist, create it.
Add the Polling Configuration:
Add the following code (adjust if you have existing config):

js

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import remixConfig from '@remix-run/dev'; // Or your Remix plugin if different

export default defineConfig({
  // Your existing config here...
  server: {
    watch: {
      usePolling: true,
    },
  },
});
This tells Vite's watcher (powered by Chokidar) to poll files instead of using system watchers.
If you already have a server or watch section, merge this in.
Restart Your Dev Server:

Stop the current process (Ctrl+C in console).
Run npm run dev again (or use the Replit Run button if configured).
If the workflow in .replit is set up, it should trigger automatically.
Additional Optimizations
Ignore Unnecessary Directories: To reduce polling overhead, add ignores for large/irrelevant paths:
js

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
server: {
  watch: {
    usePolling: true,
    ignored: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/.git/**', '**/.pnpm/**'],
  },
}
This skips watching node_modules (and pnpm's internal symlinks), which often causes the bloat leading to ENOSPC.
Prune pnpm Store: Run pnpm store prune to remove unused packages from the store, potentially reducing watched files if Vite still scans them indirectly.
If Polling Impacts Performance: As a last resort, experiment with followSymlinks: false in the watch options to avoid resolving/traversing pnpm's symlinked store files:
js

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
watch: {
  usePolling: true,
  followSymlinks: false,
}
This should resolve the ENOSPC error without needing system-level changes. If it doesn't (e.g., due to Remix-specific quirks), share your full vite.config.js, package.json scripts, and .replit file for further tweaks. If you're open to it, consider migrating to a local setup or another platform where sysctl adjustments are easier.
